**As a part of Let's Grow More Internship, here's my project : Image to Pencil Sketch with Python. **
I have read the image in RBG format and then converted it to a grayscale image. Then the next thing I did is inverting the grayscale image also called negative image, this is my inverted grayscale image. Then I finally created the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image.
